        <h3>I have done 2 projects</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Student database management system Project</li>
            <li>Capstone Project</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Student database management system Project</h2>
        <p class="s">During my diploma, I led a team to develop a student database management system that simplifies the process of managing and accessing student information. As the team leader, I divided the project into smaller parts and assigned specific tasks to each team member based on their strengths. The projectâ€™s primary goal was to create a user-friendly website that allows college staff to manage and search student details quickly and efficiently.
        The website was designed to be simple, ensuring that staff could access student information in less time and with minimal effort. The search feature allows for quick retrieval of any student's data, making it an efficient tool for college administration.</p>
        <h2>Capstone Project</h2>
        <p class="s">During my industrial training on Full Stack Development, I worked on a Capstone Project that allowed me to apply the skills I had gained throughout the course. This project was an individual effort where I was challenged to design, develop, and deploy a complete web application from start to finish.
        The primary objective of this project was to test my ability to build a functional, scalable, and user-friendly application by utilizing both front-end and back-end technologies. It provided an opportunity to demonstrate how well I could integrate the different parts of a full-stack project, including the database, server, and user interface.
